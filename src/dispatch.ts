 * - **cold** (no payment proof): answered with the `402` challenge
 * - **x402** (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`): run through the x402 verify/settle flow
 * - **MPP** (`Authorization`): run through the MPP verify flow
 * - **collision** (both rails at once): rejected with `400`
 *
 * A deployment can disable a rail through `ENABLED_RAILS`. An attempt on a
 * disabled rail is answered with the cold `402`, which advertises only the rails
