A pay-per-request proxy in front of the [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/).
Instead of an API key, each request carries a stablecoin micropayment, making the signed payment
act as the credential.

`bx402` is `bx` ([Brave Search CLI](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-cli)) + `402`, the HTTP *Payment Required* status.
The `402` is the shared mechanism, not a rail, so **x402** (USDC
on Base) and **MPP** (pathUSD on Tempo) are equally first-class.

## How it works

1. A request with no payment receives one `402 Payment Required` that advertises both rails.
2. The client retries with the header matching its wallet, either x402 or MPP.
3. On a valid payment the request is forwarded to Brave Search and the result is returned
   with the settlement receipt.

One hostname serves both rails. The rail is chosen by the client's payment header.

## Prerequisites

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or newer with `corepack enable` (pnpm
comes from the `packageManager` field), and a Brave Search API key (free tier at
[brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api)).

## Paying for a search on Base Sepolia

This runs `bx402` in Docker against the public
[x402.org facilitator](https://docs.x402.org/dev-tools/facilitators), which verifies each
payment and settles it on chain. It serves testnet only and pays the settlement gas
itself, so nothing on the Brave side needs funding. Production points
`X402_FACILITATOR_URL` at the
[Coinbase-hosted facilitator](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/facilitator)
instead, with `CDP_API_KEY_ID` and `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` set beside it; the service
signs every facilitator call with that key and refuses to send credentials to any
other facilitator host.

| Party            | Owner | Requires          | Faucet                               |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Payer wallet     | Agent | Base Sepolia USDC | [Circle](https://faucet.circle.com/) |
| Treasury address | Brave | nothing           | —                                    |

1. Clone, then write your Brave Search API key to `.env`:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:brave-experiments/bx402.git
   cd bx402
   echo "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-key>" >> .env
   ```
2. Start the stack:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
3. Create a payer wallet and fund it with USDC on Base Sepolia (`brew install stripe/purl/purl` if needed):
   ```sh
   purl wallet add --type evm
   purl balance --network base-sepolia
   ```
4. Pay for a search:
   ```sh
   purl inspect 'http://localhost:8080/res/v1/web/search?q=rust'
   purl -v --max-amount 10000 'http://localhost:8080/res/v1/web/search?q=rust'
   ```
   The server returns the settled tx hash in the `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` response
   header, but purl does not print it. Look the payer's USDC transfer up on
   [sepolia.basescan.org](https://sepolia.basescan.org) instead.

## Paying for a search on Tempo Moderato

No facilitator here: the server talks to a Tempo RPC endpoint directly, and
verifying an MPP credential is what settles it. Only the payer needs funding.

1. Write the config to `.env` and start the server (`ENABLED_RAILS=mpp` runs the MPP
   rail alone, so no facilitator config is needed; `ALLOW_TESTNET` is required because
   Moderato is a testnet):
   ```sh
   echo "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-key>" >> .env
   echo "ENABLED_RAILS=mpp" >> .env
   echo "MPP_RPC_URL=https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz" >> .env
   echo "MPP_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
   echo "ALLOW_TESTNET=true" >> .env
   pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm start
   ```
2. Create a throwaway payer and fund it from the faucet RPC method:
   ```sh
   export MPPX_PRIVATE_KEY="0x$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
   curl -s -X POST https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"tempo_fundAddress\",\"params\":[\"<payer>\"]}"
   ```
   `new_payer` in [`.github/scripts/e2e/mpp/lib.sh`](.github/scripts/e2e/mpp/lib.sh) does
   this end to end, deriving the address and waiting for the balance to land.
3. Pay for a search:
   ```sh
   npx mppx --network testnet -i 'http://localhost:8080/res/v1/web/search?q=rust'
   ```
   MPP clients print the `Payment-Receipt` header, so look the transaction up at
   `https://explore.testnet.tempo.xyz/receipt/<transaction>`.

## Endpoints

Every endpoint below is payable on both rails. Prices track Brave's published rates at
cost, in base units (5000 = $0.005). Brave's rate card names a price for Web Search and
LLM Context; the other search endpoints are charged the Web rate.

| Endpoint                       | Base units | Brave rate |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| `/res/v1/web/search`           | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/llm/context`          | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/news/search`          | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/videos/search`        | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/images/search`        | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/local/place_search`   | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/local/pois`           | 5000       | $5/1k      |
| `/res/v1/local/descriptions`   | 5000       | $5/1k      |

A path outside this table is a `404`, never a payable `402`, so the proxy forwards only
the endpoints it sells. Three kinds of endpoint are left out on purpose:

- the Answers API (`/res/v1/chat/completions`) bills per query and per token, which one
  fixed price in a `402` cannot express.
- Autosuggest (`/res/v1/suggest/search`) and Spellcheck (`/res/v1/spellcheck/search`) cost
  less than the fee a facilitator takes for settling one payment, so selling them a
  payment per query would cost more to collect than the query is worth. They wait on
  settling many queries together as one payment.
- the Summarizer (`/res/v1/summarizer/search`) is deprecated by Brave and may be removed
  without notice.

A payment is checked against the price of the path it is sent to, so a payer cannot name
its own price.

## Discovery

`GET /openapi.json` serves a machine-readable description of every paid path and the
offers each enabled rail advertises, following MPP's payment discovery draft.
`GET /llms.txt` serves the buyer's guide in prose, linked from the document's
`docs.llms`. Both are free and cached for five minutes; discovery is advisory, and the
`402` challenge stays authoritative.

## Networks

Both rails charge the same price for the same endpoint, to the same treasury, in base
units of a six decimal token. See [Endpoints](#endpoints) for the per-endpoint price.

| Rail | Mainnet             | Testnet                      | Asset   |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| x402 | Base, `eip155:8453` | Base Sepolia, `eip155:84532` | USDC    |
| MPP  | Tempo, chain 4217   | Moderato, chain 42431        | pathUSD |

`ALLOW_TESTNET=true` admits testnets. x402 then advertises the Base Sepolia offer first, so
a client taking the first offer it supports pays with faucet money. MPP discovers its chain
from `MPP_RPC_URL` at startup and refuses to start on a testnet without the variable.

`ENABLED_RAILS` picks which rails the deployment serves, as a comma-separated subset of
`x402,mpp`; unset enables both. A disabled rail's variables are not read, its challenge is
not advertised, and a payment attempt on it gets the plain 402 naming the rails that remain.
`ENABLED_RAILS=none` serves no rails at all: the service stays up and answers every payment
attempt with a 402 offering nothing, which suspends payments without taking the proxy down.

x402 verifies (a dry run that moves nothing), runs the search, then settles, so a failed
search is never charged and a returned result always means the payment settled. An MPP
credential is a signed transaction, so verifying it settles it, before the search runs.

## End-to-end tests

| Client                                                    | x402 (Base Sepolia) | MPP (Moderato) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------: | :------------: |
| [`purl`](https://github.com/stripe/purl)                  | ✅                  | —              |
| [`@x402/fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@x402/fetch) | ✅                  | —              |
| [`mppx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mppx)              | ✅                  | ✅             |
| [`tempo request`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/wallet-cli) | —                   | ✅             |

mppx pays either rail. It reaches x402 through its own protocol adapter, which reads the
`PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and answers in `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, so that leg settles through the
facilitator like any other x402 payment. The `mppx` entry in `extensions` carries the route
binding it requires before it will sign.

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics are served on port `8090`, on a listener of its own; `8080` keeps
serving traffic and `GET /health`. **Keep `8090` inside the network**, since the
exposition names every paid endpoint, how often payments are refused and why, and how
much has been charged. Scrape `localhost:8090/metrics` for the full set: every series is
prefixed `bx402_`, and one with nothing recorded yet is absent rather than zero.
